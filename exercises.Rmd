# Probability Practice

__Part A.__ Visitors to your website are asked to answer a single survey question before they get access to the content on the page. Among all of the users, there are two categories: Random Clicker (RC), and Truthful Clicker (TC). There are two possible answers to the survey: yes and no. Random clickers would click either one with equal probability. You are also giving the information that the expected fraction of random clickers is 0.3. After a trial period, you get the following survey results: 65\% said Yes and 35\% said No. What fraction of people who are truthful clickers answered yes?  Hint: use the rule of total probability.  


Rule of total probability:
$$
P(A) = \sum_{i=1}^{N}A \cap B_i = \sum_{i=1}^{N}P(B_i)P(A | B_i) \\
P(B_i,B_j) = 0 \,\,\,(i \neq j) \\
\sum_{i=1}^{N}P(B_i)=1
$$

Note: I'm using CY as shorthand for click yes and CN as shorthand for click no
Given:
- $P(CY | RC) = 0.5$ and $P(CN | RC) = 0.5$
- $P(RC) = 0.3$ and $P(TC) = 0.7$ **Do I use this information?**
- $P(CY)=0.65$ and $P(CN)=.35$

$$
P(CY | TC) = \frac{P(CY \cap TC)}{P(TC)} = \frac{P(CY)P(TC|CY)}{P(TC)}
$$
Need to determine $P(CY \cap TC)$ by using total probability theorem.

$$
P(CY) = P(CY \cap RC) + P(CY \cap TC) \\
P(CY \cap TC) = P(CY) - P(CY \cap RC) = P(CY) - P(RC)P(CY | RC) = 0.65 - 0.3(0.5) = 0.5
$$

$$
P(CY | TC) = \frac{P(CY \cap TC)}{P(TC)} = \frac{0.5}{0.7} = 71.4%
$$
71.4% of the people who are truthful clickers click yes.

__Part B.__ Imagine a medical test for a disease with the following two attributes:  

- The sensitivity is about 0.993. That is, if someone has the disease, there is a probability of 0.993 that they will test positive.  
- The specificity is about 0.9999. This means that if someone doesn't have the disease, there is probability of 0.9999 that they will test negative.  
- In the general population, incidence of the disease is reasonably rare: about 0.0025% of all people have it (or 0.000025 as a decimal probability).

Suppose someone tests positive. What is the probability that they have the disease?
