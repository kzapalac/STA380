The folder containing solutions for each problem is linked below. If the question asks for brief reports (such as problem 3 and problem ...), then the PDF only displays the most essential components of our analysis. Otherwise, the PDF is a replica of the Jupyter notebook or Rmd used to perform the analyses. The Jupyter notebook or Rmd for each problem always contains the full extent of our analysis. for some problems, we have an appendix detailing additional exploration that we did but did not think was absolutely essential to answer the question.
