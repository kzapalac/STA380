Among all of the users, there are two categories: Random Clicker (RC), and Truthful Clicker (TC). There are two possible answers to the survey: yes and no. Random clickers would click either one with equal probability. You are also giving the information that the expected fraction of random clickers is 0.3. After a trial period, you get the following survey results: 65\\% said Yes and 35\\% said No. What fraction of people who are truthful clickers answered yes?  Hint: use the rule of total probability.\n",
